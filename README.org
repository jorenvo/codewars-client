* codewars
A python script that provides a cli interface to [[http://www.codewars.com][codewars.com]]. Because
noone should have to write code in a browser.
** Requirements
- Python 3
** Usage
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
usage: codewars.py [-h] [-d DESCRIPTION_FILE] [-s SOLUTION_FILE] [-t TESTS_FILE] [-k API_KEY_FILE] [-e EVALUATION_FILE] {next,submit,finalize}

Provides users with a way of using codewars.com without having to use a browser to do their programming in.

positional arguments:
  {next,submit,finalize}
                        next: setup the next kata, submit: attempt solution, finalize: finalize last submitted solution

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d DESCRIPTION_FILE, --description-file DESCRIPTION_FILE
                        file containing the description (default: description.html)
  -s SOLUTION_FILE, --solution-file SOLUTION_FILE
                        file containing the solution (default: solution.js)
  -t TESTS_FILE, --tests-file TESTS_FILE
                        file containing the tests (default: tests.js)
  -k API_KEY_FILE, --api-key-file API_KEY_FILE
                        file containing codewars.com api key (default: api_key.txt)
  -e EVALUATION_FILE, --evaluation-file EVALUATION_FILE
                        file containing the response after submitting (default: evaluation.html)
#+END_SRC
** Notes
Getting next katas and submitting works. Finalizing is something that
still needs to be done. Something that I'd first like to fix though is
setting up a proper TDD environment with Mocha. Maybe even provide a
layer so that codewars' custom Test framework would run locally. This
way the tests (or fixtures as codewars call them) could be directly
run by the user.
